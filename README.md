# Chill-Bot

Project for repeating information.

Sometimes it's necesary to repeat something you've learned while you are preapring for exam or interview. As for me, I always do it using .pdf files, where I mark questions with different colours. 
For example, green means question is successfully learned and yellow means it should be repeated again.

This bot allows you to repeat questions, choosing topic and subtopic, showing them in random order.
