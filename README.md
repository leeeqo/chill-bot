# Chill-Bot

Helps you to analyze your level of commitment for interview.

Sometimes it's necesary to repeat something you've learned while you are preapring for exam or interview. As for me, I always do it using .pdf files, where I mark questions with different colours. 
For example, green means question is successfully learned and yellow means it should be repeated again.

This bot allows you to repeat questions, showing them in random order. It's more convenient because you always have an access to your phone and Telegram and you can repeat different topics while you are going to the job or waiting for somebody if he or she is late :)
